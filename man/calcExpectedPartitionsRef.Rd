\title{Calculates the distribution of observed versus expected overlaps for a 
query set to a reference assembly}
\usage{
calcExpectedPartitionsRef(query, refAssembly, bpProportion = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{A GenomicRanges or GenomicRangesList object with query regions}

\item{refAssembly}{A character vector specifying the reference genome
assembly (*e.g.* 'hg19'). This will be used to grab annotation 
models with \code{getGeneModels}, and chromosome sizes with\code{getChromSizes}}

\item{bpProportion}{logical indicating if overlaps should be calculated based
on number of base pairs overlapping with each partition. 
bpProportion=FALSE does overlaps in priority order, 
bpProportion=TRUE counts number of overlapping
base pairs between query and each partition.}
}
\value{
A data.frame indicating the number of query region overlaps in   
    several genomic partitions.
}
\description{
This function is a wrapper for \code{calcExpectedPartitions} that uses 
built-in partitions for a given reference genome assembly.
}
\examples{
calcExpectedPartitionsRef(vistaEnhancers, "hg19")
calcExpectedPartitionsRef(vistaEnhancers, "hg19", bpProportion=TRUE)
}
